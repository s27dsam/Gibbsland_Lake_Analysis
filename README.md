 # Historical Analysis of the Gibbsland Lakes

Welcome to the Historical Analysis of the Gibbsland Lakes project. This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of various lakes in the Gibbsland region using advanced data science techniques. By applying Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, we dive into the past 30 years of data to understand and predict future trends in lake salinity and dissolved oxygen levels.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Analysis:** Comparative analysis of different lakes using Linear Regression to understand key parameters and their interrelationships.
- **LSTM Forecasting:** Advanced LSTM models to predict future trends in salinity and dissolved oxygen levels based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs to visualize the changes and trends in the lakes' ecological parameters.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Utilization of a rich dataset spanning over 30 years to ensure robust model training and predictions.
