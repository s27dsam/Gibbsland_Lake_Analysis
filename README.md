# Quick Historical Analysis of the Salinity and Dissolved oxygen levels of the Gibbsland Lakes

Welcome to the Historical Analysis of the Gibbsland Lakes project. This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of various lakes in the Gibbsland region using advanced data science techniques. By applying Linear Regression models, we dive into the past 30 years of data to understand and predict future trends in lake salinity and dissolved oxygen levels.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Analysis:** Comparative analysis of different lakes using Linear Regression to understand key parameters and their interrelationships.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs to visualize the changes and trends in the lakes' ecological parameters.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Utilization of a rich dataset spanning over 30 years to ensure robust model training and predictions.
